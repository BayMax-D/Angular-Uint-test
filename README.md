# Angular-Uint-test
I provided unit test and rise test result all is over 90%

How to run tests?
By the command npm test. Your project will be compiled and run Karma for running all tests in your project. It will also open your browser (default address localhost:9876) and show the test results.

spec file for unit tests
It’s important — all tests should be stored in files with name format <name-of-the-tested-file>.spec.ts. File type “spec” (stands for “specification”), tells Karma that this is the file with tests.

`npm install`

and then

`ng test`
